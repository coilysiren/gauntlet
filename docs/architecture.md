# Architecture

## Module map

```
gauntlet/
├── models.py    # all Pydantic data models — the shared vocabulary
├── auth.py      # user authentication config (BearerAuth, ApiKeyAuth, UsersConfig)
├── roles.py     # Attacker, Inspector, HoldoutVitals, WeaponAssessor protocols + demo impls
├── executor.py  # Api protocol + HttpExecutor + InMemoryTaskAPI + Drone
├── llm.py       # LLMAttacker and LLMInspector backed by OpenAI or Anthropic
├── loop.py      # GauntletRunner orchestration + risk report assembly
├── store.py     # PlanStore and FindingsStore — disk-backed knowledge indexed by weapon ID
└── cli.py       # Click entry point — reads env vars, loads config, runs GauntletRunner
```

Nothing imports from `loop.py` or `cli.py` except `__init__.py`. Dependency order is:

```
models  ←  auth
models  ←  roles
models  ←  executor
models  ←  store
models + roles + executor + store  ←  loop
models + auth + roles + executor + llm + loop  ←  cli
```

## Deterministic vs non-deterministic segments

The system is split into a **deterministic core** and **non-deterministic edges**.

**Deterministic (no LLM, no network):**

- `InMemoryTaskAPI` — in-memory REST API; pure dict operations, always same output for same input. Ships with the library as a working example SUT.
- `Drone` — resolves path templates, calls the SUT, evaluates assertions. Pure Python.
- Assertion evaluation and risk report assembly — branching logic, set unions, averages, threshold arithmetic. Fully reproducible.
- `Demo*` classes — hardcoded or regex-based implementations of each Protocol. Shipped with the library so users can run the full loop without API keys.

**Non-deterministic (LLM or network):**

- `LLMAttacker` / `LLMInspector` (`llm.py`) — call an LLM to generate plans and analyze findings. Output varies per call.
- `HttpExecutor` — sends real HTTP requests; outcome depends on network and the running server.

The `Demo*` classes are reference implementations of each Protocol in `roles.py`. They exist so that `GauntletRunner` can be exercised end-to-end in tests and examples without any external dependencies. The `LLM*` classes are the production counterparts.

## Design decisions

**Why Pydantic?** All interchange objects are `BaseModel` subclasses with
`extra="forbid"`. This catches schema drift early and makes JSON
serialization/deserialization free.

**Why 4 fixed iterations?** v0 trades flexibility for predictability. The four
goals (baseline → boundary → adversarial → targeted) form a natural escalation
ladder that works well for demo purposes. Future versions will make this
configurable.

**Why Protocols instead of ABCs?** Structural subtyping lets callers pass any
object that has the right methods without importing from `gauntlet`. This keeps
the integration surface small and avoids inheritance coupling.

**Why separate auth.py?** User credentials involve secret resolution from env
vars. Isolating this in `auth.py` keeps the rest of the codebase free of
secret-handling logic and makes the boundary clear.

**Why LLM providers are configurable per-role?** The Attacker and Inspector
can use different providers (e.g., GPT-4 vs Claude) so users can mix strengths
or reduce cost.

**Why Arsenals?** An Arsenal is a named collection of Weapons. It replaces the
earlier "policy packs" concept with vocabulary that fits the existing metaphor.
Users load an arsenal via ``--arsenal path/to/arsenal.yaml`` to run the full set
of weapons it contains. The CLI falls back to ``--weapon`` for individual
weapon files when no arsenal is specified.
