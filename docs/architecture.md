# Architecture

## Module map

├── models.py    # all Pydantic data models — the shared vocabulary
│                #   includes Action/Observation (surface-agnostic wrappers

```

Nothing imports from `loop.py` or `cli.py` except `__init__.py`. Dependency order is:

```
models  ←  auth
models  ←  adapters (http, cli, webdriver, __init__)
models  ←  roles
models + adapters  ←  executor
models + roles + executor  ←  loop
models + auth + roles + executor + llm + loop  ←  cli
```

## Data flow

```
GauntletRunner.run()

├── [preflight] WeaponAssessor.assess(weapon) — if assessor present
│     └── returns WeaponAssessment; blocked → short-circuit
│
├── for each IterationSpec (4 total):
│   ├── Attacker.generate_plans(spec, previous records)
│   │     └── returns []Plan
│   │
│   ├── Drone.run_plan(plan) × N
│   │     ├── resolves path templates from prior step responses
│   │     ├── wraps HttpRequest in Action, calls Adapter.execute(user, action)
│   │     ├── unwraps Observation back to HttpResponse
│   │     └── evaluates assertions → []AssertionResult

└── _build_risk_report(records)
      ├── aggregates findings across all iterations
      ├── derives coverage from all executed steps

## Deterministic vs non-deterministic segments

The system is split into a **deterministic core** and **non-deterministic edges**.

**Deterministic (no LLM, no network):**

- `InMemoryTaskAPI` — in-memory REST API; pure dict operations, always same output for same input. Ships with the library as a working example SUT.
- `Drone` — resolves path templates, calls the SUT, evaluates assertions. Pure Python.
- Assertion evaluation and risk report assembly — branching logic, set unions, averages, threshold arithmetic. Fully reproducible.
- `Demo*` classes — hardcoded or regex-based implementations of each Protocol. Shipped with the library so users can run the full loop without API keys.

**Non-deterministic (LLM or network):**

- `LLMAttacker` / `LLMInspector` (`llm.py`) — call an LLM to generate plans and analyze findings. Output varies per call.
- `HttpExecutor` — sends real HTTP requests; outcome depends on network and the running server.

The `Demo*` classes are reference implementations of each Protocol in `roles.py`. They exist so that `GauntletRunner` can be exercised end-to-end in tests and examples without any external dependencies. The `LLM*` classes are the production counterparts.

## Design decisions

**Why Pydantic?** All interchange objects are `BaseModel` subclasses with
`extra="forbid"`. This catches schema drift early and makes JSON
serialization/deserialization free.

**Why 4 fixed iterations?** v0 trades flexibility for predictability. The four
goals (baseline → boundary → adversarial → targeted) form a natural escalation
ladder that works well for demo purposes. Future versions will make this
configurable.

**Why Protocols instead of ABCs?** Structural subtyping lets callers pass any
object that has the right methods without importing from `gauntlet`. This keeps
the integration surface small and avoids inheritance coupling.

**Why separate auth.py?** User credentials involve secret resolution from env
vars. Isolating this in `auth.py` keeps the rest of the codebase free of
secret-handling logic and makes the boundary clear.

**Why Action/Observation instead of passing HttpRequest/HttpResponse directly?**
The adversarial loop should not be coupled to a single execution surface.
Action wraps an HttpRequest today (and CLI commands or WebDriver interactions
tomorrow); Observation wraps the corresponding response.  The Drone converts
between the two layers so the rest of the system stays surface-agnostic.
Adapters implement both ``send`` (HTTP shorthand) and ``execute``
(Action/Observation) so existing callers keep working.

**Why LLM providers are configurable per-role?** The Attacker and Inspector
can use different providers (e.g., GPT-4 vs Claude) so users can mix strengths
or reduce cost.
