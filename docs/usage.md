# Usage

Workflow guide for AI agents operating in CI pipelines or agentic dark factory loops. For CLI flags and environment variable reference, see the [README](../README.md).

## When to run Gauntlet

Run Gauntlet after your existing tests pass and before promoting or merging. It is not a test runner — it assumes the code and its tests share the same blind spots, because they were likely written by the same agent. Running it before promotion adds a second inspection pass from a model that has no knowledge of how the code was written.

Place it as the final checkpoint in your CI pipeline or agentic loop.

## Set up credentials

Export credentials for both roles before running:

```bash
export GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_TYPE=openai
export GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_KEY=sk-...
export GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_TYPE=anthropic
export GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Gauntlet supports both cross-provider and single-provider configurations. Cross-provider (e.g. OpenAI Attacker + Anthropic Inspector) is the default posture — model diversity reduces shared blind spots. Single-provider (both roles on the same provider) is appropriate for agentic-loop consumers that run inside one subscription and one auth context; it trades some blind-spot coverage for integration simplicity. Default models are `gpt-4o` (OpenAI) and `claude-opus-4-5` (Anthropic).

In CI, set these as secrets. In an agentic loop, they are inherited from the environment.

See the [README](../README.md#llm-configuration) for the full reference table.

## Write weapons

Weapons define attack strategies that are reusable across API surfaces. Each weapon is a YAML file in `.gauntlet/weapons/`.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/weapons/task_ownership.yaml
title: Users cannot modify each other's tasks
description: >
  The task API must enforce resource ownership. A user who did not create
  a task must not be able to modify or delete it.
blockers:
  - A PATCH request by a non-owner is rejected with 403
  - The task body is unchanged after an unauthorized PATCH attempt
  - A GET by the owner after an unauthorized PATCH returns the original data
```

**The train/test split:** `blockers` are never shown to the Attacker — only to the holdout evaluator. This means the agent that wrote the code cannot inadvertently write code that passes by knowing what the checks are. Keep `blockers` statements specific and falsifiable.

Tips:
- One weapon per file — name the file after the property it protects (e.g. `task_ownership.yaml`)
- `blockers` are Vitals — externally observable truths about system behavior. Write them as falsifiable statements about what the system does, not how it does it, and not in terms specific to any execution surface

## Write targets

Targets define the API surface a weapon is tested against. Each target is a YAML file in `.gauntlet/targets/`.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/targets/task_endpoints.yaml
title: Task ownership endpoints
endpoints:
  - POST /tasks
  - PATCH /tasks/{id}
  - GET /tasks/{id}
```

One weapon can be paired with many targets — the runner executes one pass per weapon/target combination. If no targets are configured, each weapon runs without a specific target.

### User authentication

If your API uses authentication, create `.gauntlet/users.yaml` to provide per-user credentials. Users omitted from the file fall back to the default `X-User: <name>` header.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/users.yaml
users:
  alice:
    type: bearer
    token_env: ALICE_TOKEN       # export ALICE_TOKEN=eyJ...
  bob:
    type: api_key
    header: X-API-Key
    key_env: BOB_API_KEY         # export BOB_API_KEY=sk-...
```

See the [README](../README.md#user-authentication) for supported authentication types.

## Validate YAML against JSON Schema

Gauntlet ships JSON Schemas for every user-authored artifact under [`gauntlet/schemas/`](../gauntlet/schemas/): `weapon.schema.json`, `target.schema.json`, `arsenal.schema.json`, and `users.schema.json`. Planners can validate their output before running Gauntlet — useful in agentic-loop pipelines where malformed YAML would otherwise surface as a cryptic Pydantic error at runtime.

```bash
# One-shot validation with check-jsonschema (pipx install check-jsonschema)
check-jsonschema --schemafile gauntlet/schemas/weapon.schema.json .gauntlet/weapons/*.yaml
check-jsonschema --schemafile gauntlet/schemas/arsenal.schema.json .gauntlet/authz_arsenal.yaml
```

For editor autocomplete, point the [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) at the schemas via `# yaml-language-server: $schema=...` at the top of a file, or via `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "gauntlet/schemas/weapon.schema.json": ".gauntlet/weapons/*.yaml",
    "gauntlet/schemas/target.schema.json": ".gauntlet/targets/*.yaml",
    "gauntlet/schemas/users.schema.json": ".gauntlet/users.yaml"
  }
}
```

The schemas are generated from the Pydantic models — if you edit [`gauntlet/models.py`](../gauntlet/models.py) or [`gauntlet/auth.py`](../gauntlet/auth.py), regenerate with `uv run python scripts/export_schemas.py`. A drift test in [`tests/test_schemas.py`](../tests/test_schemas.py) fails CI if you forget.

## Configuration file

All CLI options can be specified in a YAML config file. By default, Gauntlet loads `.gauntlet/config.yaml` if it exists. Use `--config` to point to a different file.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/config.yaml
url: http://localhost:8000
weapon: .gauntlet/weapons
target: .gauntlet/targets
users: .gauntlet/users.yaml
threshold: 0.90
fail_fast: true
format: yaml      # or: json
```

CLI flags always override values from the config file. For example, to use a config file but override the threshold:

```bash
gauntlet --threshold 0.50
```

If both a config file and a positional URL are provided, the positional URL takes precedence.

## Arsenals

Individual weapons test one property at a time. That's useful during development, but in CI you want to run an entire class of attacks in one shot — authorization checks, input validation, OWASP top-10 — without listing every weapon file on the command line. An Arsenal is a named collection of weapons bundled in a single YAML file that solves this problem. It lets you version, share, and select attack surfaces as a unit.

Use `--arsenal` instead of `--weapon` to load all weapons from one file:

```yaml
# .gauntlet/authz_arsenal.yaml
name: authz
description: Authorization and ownership enforcement weapons
weapons:
  - id: identity_swap
    title: Users cannot access or modify each other's resources
    description: >
      The API must enforce resource ownership at every endpoint.
    blockers:
      - A write request by a non-owner is rejected with 403 or 404
      - A read request by a non-owner returns 403 or 404
```

```bash
gauntlet http://localhost:8000 --arsenal .gauntlet/authz_arsenal.yaml
```

When `--arsenal` is provided, it takes precedence over `--weapon`.

## OpenAPI-driven targets

If your API has an OpenAPI 3.x spec, use `--openapi` to auto-generate Target objects from the spec instead of writing them by hand:

```bash
gauntlet http://localhost:8000 --openapi openapi.yaml
```

Targets parsed from the spec are combined with any manually-defined targets from `--target`. This is useful for broad coverage without maintaining a separate target file for every endpoint.

## Run Gauntlet

### Exit codes

Gauntlet uses a stable exit-code taxonomy so orchestrators can distinguish "ran clean" from "found failures" from "Gauntlet itself errored":

| Code | Meaning | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Clearance | Every weapon/target pair completed and no clearance gate recommended `block`. Safe to promote. |
| `1` | Blocked by findings | Gauntlet ran to completion and at least one weapon/target pair returned a `block` recommendation. |
| `2` | Runtime error | Gauntlet started running but an unexpected error interrupted it (LLM provider unreachable, adapter failure, unhandled exception in the runner). Retryable. |
| `3` | Config / usage error | Gauntlet rejected its inputs before running (missing URL, missing env vars, unknown provider, malformed `--format`, config file not found). Not retryable without a config change. |

Orchestrator guidance:

- `0` — promote.
- `1` — route the risk report's `confirmed_failures` back to the Planner (not the Worker). See [Multi-agent orchestration](#multi-agent-orchestration-dark-factory-style-loops).
- `2` — retry with backoff; surface to a human after N attempts.
- `3` — do not retry. The operator or the Orchestrator's config generator must fix the invocation.

These codes are a contract: they will not change within a major version. Click's argument-parser errors (e.g. passing an unrecognized flag) bypass this taxonomy and exit with Click's default (`2`); this only trips a misconfigured orchestrator wrapper, not a deployed loop.

### CI pipeline

Run after all tests pass. Treat exit code `1` as "do not promote"; treat `2` or `3` as a broken build invocation, not a code-quality signal.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Gauntlet
  run: gauntlet ${{ env.STAGING_URL }}
  env:
    GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_TYPE: openai
    GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_TYPE: anthropic
    GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Agentic loop

Run after code is written and a staging environment is running, before marking a task complete:

1. Write code
2. Run existing tests — if they fail, fix and repeat
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run `gauntlet <staging-url>`
5. Interpret results (see below) and act

Gauntlet is the final check before declaring work done. Do not skip it.

See the [README](../README.md#cli) for CLI flags and invocation syntax.

### Multi-agent orchestration (dark-factory-style loops)

When Gauntlet is invoked by an orchestrator that also drives code generation (a "dark factory" pipeline: product spec → planner → worker → deploy → Gauntlet → risk report → promote or iterate), the train/test split becomes load-bearing at the orchestration level as well as inside Gauntlet.

Recommended role layout:

- **Planner** authors `.gauntlet/weapons/*.yaml` from the product spec, **including `blockers`**. The Planner is the only role that derives invariants from the spec.
- **Worker** generates code in its own worktree. The Worker **must never see `blockers`** — not the weapon files, not the risk report's `confirmed_failures` phrased as "you failed to preserve X". Pass it only the spec and task description. This is the orchestration-level analog of Gauntlet's internal train/test split: the Attacker never sees blockers inside Gauntlet; the Worker never sees them outside it.
- **Orchestrator** invokes `gauntlet <deployed-url>` as a subprocess once the Worker's output is deployed. Consumes the YAML risk report. On failure, routes `confirmed_failures` back to the Planner (not the Worker) for task-level remediation — the Planner can translate "cross-user modification allowed" back into a new spec-aligned task without leaking the blocker verbatim.

Gauntlet itself is indifferent to how Weapons were produced. The separation above is an orchestrator concern, not a Gauntlet-CLI concern. But if your orchestrator plans to re-invoke Gauntlet after Worker iteration, keep the weapon files stable across the loop — the value of the holdout evaporates if `blockers` churn alongside the code under test.

## Interpret results and act

Gauntlet outputs a YAML risk report:

```yaml
risk_report:
  confidence_score: 0.06
  risk_level: critical
  confirmed_failures:
    - unauthorized_cross_user_modification
  coverage:
    - GET /tasks/42
    - PATCH /tasks/42
    - POST /tasks
  conclusion: >-
    System fails under adversarial pressure and should not be promoted
    without remediation.
```

Act based on `risk_level`:

| risk_level | Action |
|---|---|
| `low` | Promote or merge |
| `medium` | Attempt fixes, re-run Gauntlet |
| `high` or `critical` | Stop. Do not attempt automated fixes. Surface to a human. |

A `high` or `critical` result means the agent has drifted from the intended behavior. Automated fixes are likely to make things worse. Human realignment is required.

### Accumulate failure knowledge

Save the `confirmed_failures` from each run. Over time this becomes a knowledge base of failure patterns. Reference it when writing new weapons and reviewing code — recurring failures indicate systemic gaps in weapon coverage.

## Example AGENTS.md — single-agent workflow

If your coding agent reads an `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.) to learn project conventions, add a section that tells it to run Gauntlet as a final step. Here is a complete example you can adapt:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Workflow

After any code change:

1. Run tests — `pytest` (or your test command). All tests must pass.
2. Run linting and formatting checks.
3. Deploy to the local/staging environment.
4. Run Gauntlet as the final check before marking work complete:

   ```bash
   gauntlet http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Interpreting Gauntlet results

- `risk_level: low` — safe to commit and promote.
- `risk_level: medium` — attempt fixes and re-run.
- `risk_level: high` or `critical` — **stop**. Do not attempt automated fixes. Surface the result to a human.

## Writing weapons

When adding a new API endpoint or modifying authorization logic, check whether
an existing weapon in `.gauntlet/weapons/` covers the change. If not, create a
new weapon YAML file. See the [Gauntlet usage docs](docs/usage.md#write-weapons)
for the format.

## Accumulating failure knowledge

After each Gauntlet run, save the `confirmed_failures` list. Reference it when
writing new code — recurring failures indicate blind spots that need dedicated
weapons or architectural fixes.
```

## Example AGENTS.md — multi-agent / dark-factory workflow

If your orchestrator dispatches distinct Planner and Worker sub-agents (see [Multi-agent orchestration](#multi-agent-orchestration-dark-factory-style-loops) above), the conventions split by role. Example shape for a Worker `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md (Worker role)

## Scope

You are the Worker. You write code to satisfy the task description passed to you by the Orchestrator. You do not author invariants, you do not see `blockers`, and you do not run Gauntlet.

## Hidden context

Do not read `.gauntlet/weapons/*.yaml`. Those files contain holdout invariants the Orchestrator uses to validate your output. Reading them would defeat the train/test split and invalidate the run.

If you need to know what behavior is expected, read the task description and the product spec. Do not infer from weapon files.

## Workflow

1. Implement the task in your worktree.
2. Run the project's existing tests — `pytest` (or equivalent).
3. Commit on your worktree branch.
4. Return. The Orchestrator deploys, invokes Gauntlet, and routes any findings back to the Planner.

## If Gauntlet findings come back

The Orchestrator will hand you a paraphrased task ("add a 403 response when a non-owner attempts PATCH"). You implement the task. You do not see the original `blockers` line the finding was derived from.
```

A matching Planner `AGENTS.md` would describe the reverse: author `.gauntlet/weapons/*.yaml` from the spec (including `blockers`), never write code, and translate Gauntlet findings back into spec-aligned Worker tasks without leaking blocker text.
