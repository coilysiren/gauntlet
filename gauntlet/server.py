"""MCP server exposing Gauntlet's deterministic primitives.

Gauntlet runs exclusively inside a Claude Code session driven by a
dark-factory orchestrator. Per-role subagents (gauntlet-attacker,
gauntlet-inspector, gauntlet-holdout-evaluator) call this MCP server for
the deterministic pieces: weapon loading, plan execution against the SUT,
run-buffer management, and clearance assembly.

The train/test split is enforced at the Claude Code permission layer via
the subagents' MCP-tool allowlists, plus at the buffer boundary by
``record_iteration`` (which rejects findings carrying blocker text).
