"""Run-scoped buffer for iteration records and holdout results.

Owned by Gauntlet so every consumer inherits the same per-run filesystem
layout. The orchestrator calls ``start_run`` once at the top of a hardening
loop, then per-role subagents append iteration and holdout artifacts via the
MCP tool surface. The buffer is short-lived: one run, one host session. No
history across runs is preserved or required.

Storage layout under ``root/<run_id>/``::

    manifest.json                     # run metadata: weapon_ids, started_at
    <weapon_id>/iterations.jsonl      # one IterationRecord per line
    <weapon_id>/holdouts.jsonl        # one HoldoutResult per line

JSONL is chosen so multiple subagent processes can append concurrently (one
process per role, possibly across separate Claude Code sessions) without
needing a shared lock — each writer appends a self-contained line. On POSIX,
``_append`` takes an ``fcntl.flock`` on the file handle for the duration of
the write to prevent byte interleaving under concurrent writers. On non-POSIX
platforms (Windows CI) ``fcntl`` is unavailable and the code falls back to
plain append, which is still safe for single-process writers.

Train/test enforcement: ``record_iteration`` raises if any finding carries
``violated_blocker``. The Inspector role never sees blocker text, so a
populated ``violated_blocker`` here means either the role discipline broke
or the buffer is being misused as a holdout sink.
