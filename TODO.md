# TODO

Internally generalize request/response into Action/Observation. The attacker produces actions, adapters execute them, and inspectors evaluate observations. This enables expansion without changing the mental model.

Keep the 4-iteration ladder but explicitly define its intent. Label them as baseline, boundary, adversarial misuse, and targeted escalation. This improves interpretability without changing behavior.

Use weapons as the primary index for knowledge accumulation. Attach all findings, successful attacks, and surprising behaviors to weapon IDs. This avoids premature taxonomy while still enabling reuse.

Group weapons under the concept of an “Arsenal.” This aligns with the existing metaphor and feels more natural than “policy packs.” Example: “Run Gauntlet with the default authz arsenal.”

Lower the Python version requirement to the oldest supported version. This reduces friction for adoption, especially in CI environments. Only require newer versions if strictly necessary.

Move `pytest` to development dependencies. It should not be required at runtime for a CLI tool. This keeps the installation surface minimal and clean.

Improve CLI output with a one-line summary. For example: “BLOCK — resource_ownership_write_isolation violated via unauthorized PATCH.” This gives immediate clarity without reading the full report.

Show attack progression metrics in output. Include number of iterations, plans generated, and successful escalations. This helps users understand how deeply the system probed.

Enforce naming discipline for long-term knowledge accumulation. Stable weapon IDs and consistent blocker phrasing matter more than adding new schema fields. Without this, accumulated data will fragment and lose value.

- installation should assume we aren't testing against a python project
- end to end pipeline examples, eg. full dark factory workflow, should include `AGENTS.md` guidance on how to use it
- readme out of sync with github description
- shorter cuter descriptions can be written now that we have the inspector weapon target wording
- litellm
- docker hub
- homebrew
- pypi

actually use it !!!
