# ⚡🔄🛂 Flux Gate

Flux Gate is a two-agent adversarial loop that infers software correctness by observing how code behaves under sustained, targeted attack. It's designed as quality control for a dark factory environment — where code is written by bots and verified by attack.

The name comes from the flux gate magnetometer: a sensor that detects weak fields by actively saturating a ferromagnetic core, revealing distortions that passive measurement would miss. Here, the Adversary saturates the system under test across escalating tiers of pressure until hidden failure modes become detectable — then gates promotion on whether any signal came through.

AI-written code can look correct — following conventions, passing linting, reading plausibly — while hiding behavioral failures that only surface under real use. Traditional tests don't catch this because the same agent that wrote the code also wrote the tests, sharing the same blind spots. Flux Gate is built for this: the Adversary assumes the code is broken and generates scenarios the code author never considered, and the `must_hold` properties in each Weapon are never shown to the Operator, preserving a real train/test split that prevents the agent from inadvertently writing code that passes by knowing what the tests check.

## Quick start

Set your LLM credentials, then point Flux Gate at a running API:

```bash
export FLUX_GATE_OPERATOR_TYPE=openai
export FLUX_GATE_OPERATOR_KEY=sk-...
export FLUX_GATE_ADVERSARY_TYPE=anthropic
export FLUX_GATE_ADVERSARY_KEY=sk-ant-...

git clone git@github.com:coilysiren/flux-gate.git
cd flux-gate
docker compose run --rm demo
```

That starts the demo API and runs the full adversarial loop against it.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flux-gate
# or: uv add flux-gate
```

## Usage

For workflow guidance (when to run, how to integrate, how to act on results), see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

### LLM configuration

Flux Gate requires one LLM for the Operator role and one for the Adversary role. Configure
each with a pair of environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `FLUX_GATE_OPERATOR_TYPE` | LLM provider for the Operator: `openai` or `anthropic` |
| `FLUX_GATE_OPERATOR_KEY` | API key for the Operator's provider |
| `FLUX_GATE_ADVERSARY_TYPE` | LLM provider for the Adversary: `openai` or `anthropic` |
| `FLUX_GATE_ADVERSARY_KEY` | API key for the Adversary's provider |

The default models are `gpt-4o` for OpenAI and `claude-opus-4-5` for Anthropic.
Using different providers for each role is intentional — model diversity reduces blind spots.

### CLI

```
flux-gate <url> [--weapon FILE_OR_DIR] [--actors FILE] [--threshold N] [--no-fail-fast]
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | required | Base URL of the running API |
| `--weapon` | `.flux_gate/weapons` | Path to an [Weapon YAML](#guards) file, or a directory of YAML files (one weapon per file) |
| `--actors` | `.flux_gate/actors.yaml` | Path to an [actors YAML](#actor-authentication) file |
| `--threshold` | `0.90` | Holdout satisfaction score required to recommend merge |
| `--fail-fast` / `--no-fail-fast` | enabled | Stop at the first critical finding; use `--no-fail-fast` to run all iterations |

```bash
flux-gate http://localhost:8000
flux-gate http://localhost:8000 --no-fail-fast
flux-gate http://localhost:8000 --weapon /path/to/weapons/ --actors /path/to/actors.yaml
flux-gate http://localhost:8000 --weapon /path/to/single_weapon.yaml
```

Output is YAML:

```yaml
risk_report:
  confidence_score: 0.06
  risk_level: critical
  confirmed_failures:
    - unauthorized_cross_user_modification   # userB rewrote userA's task
  coverage:
    - GET /tasks/42
    - PATCH /tasks/42
    - POST /tasks
  conclusion: >-
    System fails under adversarial pressure and should not be promoted
    without remediation.
```

### Project config directory

Place your Flux Gate config files in a `.flux_gate/` directory at the root of your project.
The CLI discovers them automatically — no flags needed for the common case:

```
your-project/
├── .flux_gate/
│   ├── weapons/            # one YAML file per Weapon — all loaded automatically
│   │   ├── task_ownership.yaml
│   │   └── task_read_isolation.yaml
│   └── actors.yaml            # Actor auth — loaded automatically if present
└── ...
```

Override either path with `--weapon FILE_OR_DIR` or `--actors FILE`.

### Weapons

A Weapon defines a property the system must maintain under adversarial pressure.
The `must_hold` properties are never shown to the Operator — only to the holdout evaluator —
preserving the train/test separation.

```yaml
# .flux_gate/weapons/task_ownership.yaml
title: Users cannot modify each other's tasks
description: >
  The task API must enforce resource ownership. A user who did not create
  a task must not be able to modify or delete it.
must_hold:
  - A PATCH request by a non-owner is rejected with 403
  - The task body is unchanged after an unauthorized PATCH attempt
  - A GET by the owner after an unauthorized PATCH returns the original data
target_endpoints:
  - POST /tasks
  - PATCH /tasks/{id}
  - GET /tasks/{id}
```

### Actor authentication

Create `.flux_gate/actors.yaml` to provide per-actor credentials. Secret values are
never stored in the file — each entry names an environment variable that holds the
actual credential. Actors omitted from the file fall back to the default `X-Actor: <name>` header.

```yaml
# .flux_gate/actors.yaml
actors:
  alice:
    type: bearer
    token_env: ALICE_TOKEN       # export ALICE_TOKEN=eyJ...
  bob:
    type: api_key
    header: X-API-Key
    key_env: BOB_API_KEY         # export BOB_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Supported authentication types:

| Type | Fields | Header sent |
|---|---|---|
| `bearer` | `token_env` | `Authorization: Bearer <$token_env>` |
| `api_key` | `header`, `key_env` | `<header>: <$key_env>` |

## Core Model

Flux Gate treats code change correctness as a problem of behavioral observation while under attack.

* Code is assumed to be untrusted, potentially written but a human - but designed to be written by a bot
* Tests are generated dynamically
* Confidence emerges from what survives adversarial probing

It asks: "How hard did we try to break this, and what happened when we did?"

## The Two Roles

### The Operator

Explores the execution space

* Constructs plausible, production-like scenarios
* Simulates how the system will actually be used (and misused)
* Explores workflows, edge cases, and state transitions
* Adapts based on what has already been tested

The Operator is not trying to prove correctness. It is trying to create situations where correctness might fail.

### The Adversary

Applies intelligent pressure

* Analyzes execution results for weaknesses
* Identifies suspicious passes and untested assumptions
* Forms hypotheses about hidden failure modes
* Forces the next round of scenarios toward likely breakpoints

The Adversary assumes "This system is broken. I just haven't proven it yet."

### Dynamic Between Them

* The Operator explores
* The Adversary sharpens
* Execution grounds both

Together, they perform a form of guided adversarial search over the space of possible failures.

## What Makes This Different

Flux Gate is not:

* a test runner
* a code reviewer
* a fuzzing tool

It is an adversarial inference engine for software correctness.

It combines:

* dynamic scenario generation (like red teaming)
* execution grounding (like CI)
* adversarial refinement (like security testing)

## Prior Art

These projects informed Flux Gate's design.

### [StrongDM Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/)

Production dark factory — code is written and reviewed entirely by agents.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **satisfaction metrics** (probabilistic 0–1 scores, not boolean pass/fail) and the principle that **scenarios live outside the codebase** to prevent reward-hacking (Flux Gate uses `.flux_gate/spec.yaml`).

Architectural divergence: the Software Factory maintains a Digital Twin Universe — behavioral clones of third-party services that agents test against without hitting real infrastructure. Flux Gate has no twin layer; it requires a running HTTP server and sends real requests. The Software Factory is also a full code-generation pipeline; Flux Gate is only a gate. It verifies code already written, it does not write code.

### [OctopusGarden](https://github.com/foundatron/octopusgarden)

Open-source autonomous development platform with a convergence-based loop.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **stratified scenario difficulty** (Flux Gate's four tiers: baseline → boundary → adversarial → targeted) and the **attractor loop** concept — iterating until a threshold is met (Flux Gate's `--threshold` flag).

Architectural divergence: OctopusGarden's loop is dynamic — it runs until satisfaction converges, with stall recovery via high-temperature "wonder" phases and model escalation (cheap model first, premium model after non-improving iterations). Flux Gate's loop is fixed-depth: four tiers, one pass. There is no stall detection, no wonder phase, and no model escalation. The tradeoff is predictability and cost over adaptive thoroughness.

### [Fabro](https://github.com/fabro-sh/fabro)

Open-source dark factory orchestrator with a graph-based workflow engine.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **human-in-the-loop gates** — Fabro's hexagon gates are checkpoints where a human can block promotion. Flux Gate's `MergeGate` plays the same role, but the decision is made by the Adversary LLM rather than a human.

Architectural divergence: Fabro models workflows as directed graphs (Graphviz DOT files, version-controlled alongside code). Flux Gate has no graph engine — its pipeline is a fixed linear sequence of iterations. Fabro also supports multi-model routing via CSS-like stylesheets and per-stage Git checkpointing. Flux Gate has neither: model assignment is static (one Operator, one Adversary) and there is no checkpointing between iterations.
