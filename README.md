# Gauntlet

**Find real vulnerabilities in your API using adversarial AI.**

Gauntlet uses two AI agents in an adversarial loop to find bugs that traditional testing misses. One agent attacks your API with escalating, production-realistic scenarios. The other watches for failures, sharpens the next round of attacks, and decides whether the system is safe to ship.

## Demo

Try it in under a minute with the built-in demo API:

```bash
export GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_TYPE=openai
export GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_KEY=sk-...
export GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_TYPE=anthropic
export GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_KEY=sk-ant-...

git clone git@github.com:coilysiren/gauntlet.git
cd gauntlet
docker compose run --rm demo
```

## Example output

```yaml
risk_report:
  confidence_score: 0.06
  risk_level: critical
  confirmed_failures:
    - unauthorized_cross_user_modification   # userB rewrote userA's task
  coverage:
    - GET /tasks/42
    - PATCH /tasks/42
    - POST /tasks
  conclusion: >-
    System fails under adversarial pressure and should not be promoted
    without remediation.
```

## Quick start

Install Gauntlet:

```bash
pip install gauntlet
# or: uv add gauntlet
```

Point it at your running API:

```bash
gauntlet http://localhost:8000
```

That's it. Gauntlet discovers your `.gauntlet/` config directory, loads weapons and targets, and runs the full adversarial loop.

For workflow guidance (when to run, how to integrate, how to act on results), see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Usage

### LLM configuration

Gauntlet requires one LLM for the Attacker role and one for the Inspector role. Configure
each with a pair of environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_TYPE` | LLM provider for the Attacker: `openai` or `anthropic` |
| `GAUNTLET_ATTACKER_KEY` | API key for the Attacker's provider |
| `GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_TYPE` | LLM provider for the Inspector: `openai` or `anthropic` |
| `GAUNTLET_INSPECTOR_KEY` | API key for the Inspector's provider |

The default models are `gpt-4o` for OpenAI and `claude-opus-4-5` for Anthropic.
Using different providers for each role is intentional — model diversity reduces blind spots.

### CLI

```
gauntlet <url> [--weapon FILE_OR_DIR] [--target FILE_OR_DIR] [--users FILE] [--threshold N] [--no-fail-fast]
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | required | Base URL of the running API |
| `--weapon` | `.gauntlet/weapons` | Path to a [Weapon YAML](#weapons) file, or a directory of YAML files (one weapon per file) |
| `--target` | `.gauntlet/targets` | Path to a [Target YAML](#targets) file, or a directory of YAML files (one target per file) |
| `--users` | `.gauntlet/users.yaml` | Path to an [users YAML](#user-authentication) file |
| `--threshold` | `0.90` | Holdout satisfaction score required to recommend merge |
| `--fail-fast` / `--no-fail-fast` | enabled | Stop at the first critical finding; use `--no-fail-fast` to run all iterations |

```bash
gauntlet http://localhost:8000
gauntlet http://localhost:8000 --no-fail-fast
gauntlet http://localhost:8000 --weapon /path/to/weapons/ --target /path/to/targets/ --users /path/to/users.yaml
gauntlet http://localhost:8000 --weapon /path/to/single_weapon.yaml --target /path/to/single_target.yaml
```

### Project config directory

Place your Gauntlet config files in a `.gauntlet/` directory at the root of your project.
The CLI discovers them automatically — no flags needed for the common case:

```
your-project/
├── .gauntlet/
│   ├── weapons/            # one YAML file per Weapon — all loaded automatically
│   │   ├── task_ownership.yaml
│   │   └── task_read_isolation.yaml
│   ├── targets/            # one YAML file per Target — all loaded automatically
│   │   └── task_endpoints.yaml
│   └── users.yaml         # User auth — loaded automatically if present
└── ...
```

Override any path with `--weapon FILE_OR_DIR`, `--target FILE_OR_DIR`, or `--users FILE`.

### Weapons

A Weapon defines a reusable attack strategy. The `blockers` are the Weapon's **Vitals** — externally observable truths about expected system behavior — never shown to the Attacker, preserving the train/test separation.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/weapons/task_ownership.yaml
title: Users cannot modify each other's tasks
description: >
  The task API must enforce resource ownership. A user who did not create
  a task must not be able to modify or delete it.
blockers:
  - A PATCH request by a non-owner is rejected with 403
  - The task body is unchanged after an unauthorized PATCH attempt
  - A GET by the owner after an unauthorized PATCH returns the original data
```

### Targets

A Target defines the API surface a Weapon is tested against. One target per YAML file.
Point multiple targets at the same weapon to test the same attack across different API surfaces.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/targets/task_endpoints.yaml
title: Task ownership endpoints
endpoints:
  - POST /tasks
  - PATCH /tasks/{id}
  - GET /tasks/{id}
```

### User authentication

Create `.gauntlet/users.yaml` to provide per-user credentials. Secret values are
never stored in the file — each entry names an environment variable that holds the
actual credential. Users omitted from the file fall back to the default `X-User: <name>` header.

```yaml
# .gauntlet/users.yaml
users:
  alice:
    type: bearer
    token_env: ALICE_TOKEN       # export ALICE_TOKEN=eyJ...
  bob:
    type: api_key
    header: X-API-Key
    key_env: BOB_API_KEY         # export BOB_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Supported authentication types:

| Type | Fields | Header sent |
|---|---|---|
| `bearer` | `token_env` | `Authorization: Bearer <$token_env>` |
| `api_key` | `header`, `key_env` | `<header>: <$key_env>` |

## How it works

Gauntlet is **automated adversarial thinking** for your API. Instead of scanning for known vulnerability signatures, it reasons about how your system *should* behave -- then systematically tries to make it misbehave.

* Code is assumed to be untrusted until proven otherwise
* Tests are generated dynamically, not written in advance
* Confidence emerges from what survives adversarial probing

It asks: "How hard did we try to break this, and what happened when we did?"

### The Attacker

Explores the execution space:

* Constructs plausible, production-like scenarios
* Simulates how the system will actually be used (and misused)
* Explores workflows, edge cases, and state transitions
* Adapts based on what has already been tested

The Attacker is not trying to prove correctness. It is trying to create situations where correctness might fail.

### The Inspector

Applies intelligent pressure:

* Analyzes execution results for weaknesses
* Identifies suspicious passes and untested assumptions
* Forms hypotheses about hidden failure modes
* Forces the next round of attacks toward likely breakpoints

The Inspector assumes "This system is broken. I just haven't proven it yet."

### The loop

The Attacker explores. The Inspector sharpens. Execution grounds both. Together, they perform a guided adversarial search over the space of possible failures.

## What makes this different

Gauntlet is not a security scanner, a test runner, or a fuzzer. Those tools check for *known* problems. Gauntlet reasons about *unknown* ones.

It combines:

* dynamic scenario generation (like red teaming)
* execution against a real system (like CI)
* adversarial refinement (like penetration testing)

The result is automated adversarial thinking -- the kind of creative, skeptical pressure that a good security engineer or QA lead would apply, running continuously against every change.

## Prior Art

These projects informed Gauntlet's design.

### [StrongDM Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/)

Production dark factory — code is written and reviewed entirely by agents.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **satisfaction metrics** (probabilistic 0–1 scores, not boolean pass/fail) and the principle that **plans live outside the codebase** to prevent reward-hacking (Gauntlet uses `.gauntlet/spec.yaml`).

Architectural divergence: the Software Factory maintains a Digital Twin Universe — behavioral clones of third-party services that agents test against without hitting real infrastructure. Gauntlet has no twin layer; it requires a running HTTP server and sends real requests. The Software Factory is also a full code-generation pipeline; Gauntlet is only a verifier. It verifies code already written, it does not write code.

### [OctopusGarden](https://github.com/foundatron/octopusgarden)

Open-source autonomous development platform with a convergence-based loop.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **stratified plan difficulty** (Gauntlet's four tiers: baseline → boundary → adversarial → targeted) and the **attractor loop** concept — iterating until a threshold is met (Gauntlet's `--threshold` flag).

Architectural divergence: OctopusGarden's loop is dynamic — it runs until satisfaction converges, with stall recovery via high-temperature "wonder" phases and model escalation (cheap model first, premium model after non-improving iterations). Gauntlet's loop is fixed-depth: four tiers, one pass. There is no stall detection, no wonder phase, and no model escalation. The tradeoff is predictability and cost over adaptive thoroughness.

### [Fabro](https://github.com/fabro-sh/fabro)

Open-source dark factory orchestrator with a graph-based workflow engine.

Key architectural ideas adopted: **human-in-the-loop gates** — Fabro's hexagon gates are checkpoints where a human can block promotion. Gauntlet's `Clearance` plays the same role, but the decision is made by the Inspector LLM rather than a human.

Architectural divergence: Fabro models workflows as directed graphs (Graphviz DOT files, version-controlled alongside code). Gauntlet has no graph engine — its pipeline is a fixed linear sequence of iterations. Fabro also supports multi-model routing via CSS-like stylesheets and per-stage Git checkpointing. Gauntlet has neither: model assignment is static (one Attacker, one Inspector) and there is no checkpointing between iterations.
